Kana Wizard is a Quiz App developed for, _initially_, hiragana and katana general practices.
If you are not used to Japanese _"kana"_ it's strongly recommended to check out&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana'target='_blank'>Hiragana</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana" target='_blank'>Katana</a> public wiki or any learning app of your choice before trying out the Quiz.


## Locale romanization
Romanized Japanese it's often used in any context where Japanese text is targeted at non-Japanese speakers who cannot read kanji or kana, such as textbooks for foreign learners of the language.
Even if the earliest Japanese romanization system was based on Portuguese orthography the most used systems nowdays generally follows English phonology, which can be really hard for non-English speakers to follow it.
For that matter, this app has been in development to offer an unified system that enables students from different places to practice and internalize the phonology of Japanese better.
